Villa PCaso is close to town plaza and beaches at only a 3 to 5 min walk to either! (without the noise and 10-15 minute dusty walk from the north side! ). Only the sound of ocean waves and songs of abundant jungle life, sooth your senses as you take in the ever changing north coast views. On special days, a huge mountain range appears behind the horizon, like magic.\n\nEnjoy the architectural details of simple whimsical elegance, as they tickle you with surprise, calm you with curves, jazz you with originality, while some, evoke fond memories of your childhood to experience a new. Look out any portal window, or opening, and discover a new work of art “framed”, the universe paints for you daily. You will realize too, the gardens have been designed with the same attention to detail and humor to draw a smile. Shower in nature, while enjoying the vistas of Monkey mountain, or the ‘still life’ of Iguanas hoping you won’t see them in the great tree out back…, and maybe even pick a ripe banana when you are ready to dry off. You may even see rare Woodpeckers ratatat-tatting for their young’s morsel, or a flock of bright green parrots noisily “alerting the media” of they’re presence during a morning or evening rinse. From the large upper deck.. wander over, pick a succulent ripe mango for an energy boost. You may need it if you see the waves are standing up nicely, begging you to be they’re dance partner just once, with you on board. After all, surfing is one of Sayulita’s finest draws.\n\n",

In silence, you may realize for the first time… Ha!, it really does not matter!. Just then, the silence of morning is broken by your house guest laying in the “hair” of the pool below when calling out, “What day is it?” You reply in content joy.. “who cares! ” Because you still don’t know, and it really doesn’t matter, when you “live in art”!\n\n4 Bathrooms\n\nBaths 4\n\nSleeps 8\n\n",
